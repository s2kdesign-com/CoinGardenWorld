# 3. Receive a QR code of a flower

After adding a photo, the application will provide you with a QR code that you can print and stick on the pot.&#x20;

When you use the application to scan the QR code, a page will open with all the information about the flower you want.

If a user without the app scans the code, they will be redirected to the[ NFT store ](../nft-flower-shop/)where they can buy the latest photo of the flower or the flower itself if it is in a store.
