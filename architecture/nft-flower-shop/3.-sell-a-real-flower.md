# 3. Sell a real flower

### For each flower that the user has photographed, he will receive a unique QR code that he can use to put on the pot and sell in real life.&#x20;

#### How it works?

When an existing user of the system scans the QR code of his flower, the application displays all available information, such as when it was last watered, the variety, the name and other information about the flower.&#x20;

When a user scans a QR code of a flower with his phone's camera and that flower is not his own, he will automatically be redirected to our NFT store with the option to immediately purchase the flower with his crypto wallet.&#x20;

If this happens in real life, the gardener who sells the flowers will immediately receive the amount of the sale to NFTito and can actually sell him the flower if it is a flower shop, for example.
