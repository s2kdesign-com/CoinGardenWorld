# 1. Add flower as NFT

Any user using the flower app can sell their photos or the flowers themselves in the store.

Even after planting your first flower, you can start taking care of it and taking pictures.

Each new photo becomes the next level of the flower. In the NFT store, you can choose to sell one or all of the photos you've taken, so the user can capture a flower from planting to its full growth cycle and sell your collection.
