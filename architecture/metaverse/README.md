# Metaverse 🌐

Welcome to the "World of Flowers"

"World of Flowers" is a game where every single user who uses the app or takes care of at least one flower will get their own island where they can arrange and "plant" their real flowers in the metaverse.&#x20;

There are many worlds in the game, what makes a world different is the blockchain network it uses. For example, if a user uses the Binance Smart Network, their world in the metaverse will be different from that of a user using the Polygon Network.
