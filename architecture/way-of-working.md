## [Description of user flow](user-flow-diagram.md)

"World of Flowers" is a system equipped with artificial intelligence and automatic recognition of types and varieties of flowers.

&#x20;In it, users not only grow but can also develop and sell their best photos of their most beautiful flowers.&#x20;

Every single photo in the system can be created as an NFT and thus either sold in the shop or used in the flower metaverse.&#x20;

### [Step 1 - The flower application](mobile-application/)

The user starts their journey by downloading the flower app. Immediately after, he will be prompted to take a photo or upload a photo of the flower he wishes to add and will receive a QR code for quick information that he can use to put on the pot or to sell real flowers in a shop.&#x20;

The app will automatically recognize the type of flower and start reminding the user when it needs watering.&#x20;

### [Step 2 - The flower shop ](nft-flower-shop/)

Even if there isn't a single flower, any user can go to the store and buy a photo of a flower they like. These pictures or NFTs can be used to obtain rewards in the metaverse or published in the internet magazines, as the user who purchased the NFTs gets the rights to it.&#x20;

The store also allows direct sales of real flowers just by scanning a QR code&#x20;

### [Step 3 - Donations and causes](donations-and-causes/)&#x20;

True nature lovers, after earning from sales of photos of their flowers, would donate a portion of the amount to conservation and. In this part comes our donation system, where anyone can post a photo of a place in danger and the capital they need.&#x20;

Any user with a crypto wallet can donate and help save the place, and for each donation, the user will receive a contribution badge in the form of NFTs.&#x20;

### [Step 4 - Metaverse](metaverse/)

Every user with at least one uploaded flower, that they are caring for will receive an island in World of Flowers.

All islands are randomly distributed on a globe, with the size of the island growing according to the number of flowers the user has.&#x20;

By logging into the system every day, the player in the metaverse will have the opportunity to receive crypto currency, the amount of which is determined by how rare the flowers he grows in nature&#x20;

### [Step 5 - Cryptocurrency](grdn-crypto-token/)&#x20;

All transactions and exchanges and rewards received in the system are done in GRDN token.&#x20;

By taking care of more flowers, the user will have the opportunity to receive more of the flower token and develop their island in the metaverse, as well as donate the surplus to nature conservation.
