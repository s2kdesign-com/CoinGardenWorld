# Donations and causes ðŸ˜‡

### Crowdfunding

The donation system in "World of Flowers" is a unique way that users, together, can save endangered places or clear a polluted forest of waste.&#x20;

Any user of the system can take a picture of such a place and apply for financing. Even if no funds are needed, the user will receive environmental contribution and environmental protection badges in the form of NFTs for each location saved.&#x20;

### How it works&#x20;

The system works as follows: a user takes a picture of an endangered place or forest, uploads his photos with the exact location of the place, chooses a period for donations, a period of execution and required funds, and starts collecting donations.&#x20;

After the first period ends, the amount starts to be released to his wallet in 10% increments, and after each increment he has to upload a photo of the saved location.
