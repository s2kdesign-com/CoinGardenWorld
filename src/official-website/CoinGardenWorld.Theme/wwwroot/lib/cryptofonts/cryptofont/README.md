# Cryptofont
Cryptocurrency icon webfont and SVG

Open *demo.html* to see a list of all the glyphs in your font along with their codes/ligatures.

To use the generated font in desktop programs, you can install the TTF font. In order to copy the character associated with each icon, refer to the text box at the bottom right corner of each glyph in demo.html. The character inside this text box may be invisible; but it can still be copied.

You won't need any of the files located under the *demo-files* directory when including the generated font in your own projects.

If you're looking for coloured SVG icons, checkout my other project [Cryptoicons](https://github.com/monzanifabio/cryptoicons) on GitHub.
