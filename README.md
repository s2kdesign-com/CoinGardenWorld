# "World of Flowers" - Home 🏡

### Main Menu and Home Page.&#x20;

* [🌍 **·**   Homepage   ](architecture/way-of-working.md)              [ **** ](broken-reference)                                                                   **** [https://coingarden.world/](https://coingarden.world/)
  * The page presents general information about the infrastructure of the system, and for each page of the main menu, the most important information is extracted and arranged in sections according to the order of the pages in the menu.
* [📱 **·**   App - Mobile Application     ](architecture/mobile-application/)                                                  [https://app.coingarden.world/](https://app.coingarden.world/)
  * With the help of the app, you will never forget when to water your flowers and gardens. As soon as you take or attach a photo of the flower, you will receive complete information of which variety it is and what is the most perfect way to take care of it.
* 🏪[ · Store - NFT flower shop   ](architecture/nft-flower-shop/)                                                      [https://store.coingarden.world/](https://store.coingarden.world/)
  * When you take good care of your garden, let it take care of you. Go to the store and sell your collection of photos of your most beautiful flower, and if you continue to take care of it, each subsequent photo will be of a higher level and that will make it more valuable.
* [😇 · Charities - Donations and causes  ](architecture/donations-and-causes/)                                      [https://charity.coingarden.world/](https://charity.coingarden.world/)
  * Even if you don't have the opportunity to grow your own flowers, you can still go and donate some cryptocurrency to the environment. The system works as follows: a user takes a picture of an endangered place or forest, uploads his photos with the exact location of the place, chooses a period for donations, a period of execution and required funds, and starts collecting donations. After the first period ends, the amount starts to be released to his wallet in 10% increments, and after each increment he has to upload a photo of the saved location.
* [🌐 · Metaverse - Flower Universe       ](architecture/metaverse/)                                  [https://metaverse.coingarden.world/](https://metaverse.coingarden.world/)
  * A game in which you will be able to plant flowers and harvest coins (farming game). Any user with at least one uploaded flower in their care can enter the meta-universe and start collecting rewards. Players get their own island, and according to the number of flowers a user has, the size of the island will grow. For each single flower, the user can login every 24 hours and collect their GRDN tokens. The size of the tokens is determined by the level of the flower and how rare it is in nature.
* [🪙 · GRDN Token - What is GRDN Token   ](architecture/grdn-crypto-token/)                             [https://exchange.coingarden.world/](https://exchange.coingarden.world/)
  * The GRDN token is the base currency in the entire infrastructure. All donations and causes, all rewards received for taking care of the flowers, as well as the metaverse are in the main crypto currency GRDN. The crypto currency exchange app will also serve for NFTs and GRDN token staking, being active before the meta universe and rewarding our initial investors.
